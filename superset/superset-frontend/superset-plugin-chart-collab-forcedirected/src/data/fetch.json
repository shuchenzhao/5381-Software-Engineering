    "body": "Yeah, I set the limit to 2 GB, but I don’t want it to keep uploading the full 2 GB. It does start immediately tho. I can then get the stream with `request.files.get('file')`, but reading the header takes quite some time `header = file.stream.read(1024)`. So I decided to check if I could just abort the connection immediately, like in the example, and no, I can’t.\n\nFIX: Actually, I think it’s a Chrome problem now. I’ve never experienced anything like that because it works fine when using curl."
